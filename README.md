# [Havaman Web App](https://nimit0703.github.io/havaman/)


### Build a React JS weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. We will be using axios to connect with our API. There are probably a million ways to build a weather app and this is on a more basic level, but a great way to learn a few core fundamentals in React. 

## [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) :
### Access current weather data for any location including over 200,000 cities
### We collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations
###  JSON, XML, and HTML formats
### Included in both free and paid subscriptions
